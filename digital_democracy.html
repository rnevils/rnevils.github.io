        <p>
            The Digital Democracy project was a Cal Poly built multi-year long research project where a prototype system
            was built that allowed all state-level legislative proceedings to be available in text transcriptions, and
            be searchable, alertable and clippable. It began in California and expanded to Florida, New York and Texas.
            It is the first and only time in US where all legislative speeches in state legislatures are transcribed.
            For this class, we are using just a fraction of the enormous volume of data produced by the project to do
            supervised and unsupervised machine learning exercises. We will use text of the speeches and try to use
            clustering to find interesting things about them, and also use supervised learning to predict labels about
            them (mainly committee where they were spoken).
