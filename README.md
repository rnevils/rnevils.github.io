# How to Build Wave Visualizer 

dependencies

- OpenGL



Download the project from the webpage. If you are using Windows or Linux, there should be a sln file to open in Visual Studio.

If using MacOS, you will need to need to build the project first. To do so:

- mkdir build
- cd build
- cmake -G Xcode ..

Then a Xcode project file will be created. Open the project in Xcode and click the green triangle to run. (This project was last tested on Mojave)


Sample video of the program running is located in the "resources" folder.
